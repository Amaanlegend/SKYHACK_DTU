This project focuses on enhancing the efficiency and customer experience within call centers by leveraging data-driven insights to improve key performance metrics like Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST). The goal is to identify patterns in agent and customer interactions and correlate them with sentiment analysis, call reasons, and tone distribution to reduce call handling time and improve customer satisfaction.

The project explores how agent tone (neutral, calm, frustrated, angry) impacts call outcomes and customer emotions, emphasizing the need for targeted training. Additionally, it highlights the importance of reducing silence during interactions, as this is linked to lower customer sentiment. By optimizing these factors, call centers can achieve faster resolutions, higher customer satisfaction, and better resource allocation.

Through the use of advanced machine learning models and real-time monitoring, this project aims to predict call outcomes based on historical data and identify areas for continuous improvement. By reducing inefficiencies and balancing key metrics like AHT with customer satisfaction (CSAT), call centers can maintain high service quality while managing costs effectively.
